                <p>The people knelt upon the ground with awe;</p>
                <p>In my faint eyes, and that my heart beat fast</p>
                <p>Could kindle raptures so divine</p>

                <p>Recognize this poem? It's an exquisite corpse: comprised of one randomly generated line each from Walt Whitman, Oscar Wilde, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Anne BrontÃ«.</p>

                    Try making your own! Choose a number of lines, and Exquisite Verse will comb through a database of poetry and create a poem of that length out of randomly generated lines from existing poems. Writing poetry is easy! </p>
